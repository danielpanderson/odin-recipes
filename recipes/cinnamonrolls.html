    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Easy, yeasted cinnamon rolls. A crowd always gathers when they come out of the oven. 
        Favorite activity: scraping the goo off the bottom of the pan.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 x 0.25 ounce packages active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups of buttermilk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of melted butter</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups of brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. 
            Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. 
            In a small saucepan, heat the buttermilk until warm to the touch.
        </li>

        <li>Pour the buttermilk and oil into the yeast mixture; mix well. 
            Combine the flour, salt and baking soda. 
            Stir the flour mixture into the liquid 1 cup at a time, until a soft dough forms. 
            Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead 20 times. 
            Cover and let rest for 15 minutes. 
            In a small bowl, stir together the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon.
        </li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll dough out into a large rectangle. 
            Spread the brown sugar and butter mixture over the dough, roll up into a log and pinch the seam to seal. 
            Slice into 1 inch pieces and place cut side up in a lightly greased 10x15 baking pan. 
            Cover and let rise 30 minutes or cover and refrigerate overnight. 
            If baking immediately, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown. 
            Let stand for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
